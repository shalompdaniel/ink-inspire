<h2>Does it hurt more to be tattooed with a large or small needle?</h2>
<p>Professional medical tattoo practitioner Hannah Maruyama of YAMA Studios told Insider that, in her experience, using a larger needle on sensitive areas can actually decrease pain. 
   <br><br>
   "Lips, especially, are really painless when using a larger needle," Maruyama said. "It seems counterintuitive, but the larger needle means the pressure is dispersed more evenly."
   <br><br>
   You can consult with an artist to determine the best option given your choice of tattoo and location.</p>

<h2>How do tattoo artists practice when they're just starting out?</h2>
<p>Professional tattooer Josh Hall, owner of Lamar Street Tattoo Club, shared that learning to ink usually involves practicing on people you know. 
   <br><br>
   "Most people start with very patient and understanding friends who are willing to be worked on," Hall said. "A shop may also allow an apprentice to practice on clients who consent to working with a beginner."</p>

<h2>How should I prepare for my first tattoo?</h2>
<p>It's important to stay hydrated and eat a good meal before your appointment. Avoid alcohol and drugs, as they can thin your blood and increase bleeding. Make sure to wear comfortable clothing that allows easy access to the area being tattooed.</p>

<h2>What should I do if I have an allergic reaction to ink?</h2>
<p>If you experience any signs of an allergic reaction, such as swelling, redness, or itching, contact your tattoo artist or a healthcare professional immediately. They can provide guidance on the best course of action.</p>

<h2>Can I get a tattoo if I have a medical condition?</h2>
<p>It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional if you have any medical conditions. Conditions like diabetes or skin disorders can impact healing and the tattooing process, so it's best to get professional advice beforehand.</p>

<h2>How long will my tattoo take to heal?</h2>
<p>Generally, a tattoo can take anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks to heal on the surface, but deeper healing can take a few months. Proper aftercare is crucial for optimal healing and to maintain the quality of the tattoo.</p>
